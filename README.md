# Planetary Terrain

Planetary Terrain is a Unity Asset for spherical terrain with dynamic quadtree-based LOD. With it, you can make the entirety of Earth your game map, to scale!

The bulk of this code was written by me from 2017 to 2018, and sold on the Unity Asset Store until 2023. Because the asset is no longer maintained, I have decided to open source it.
